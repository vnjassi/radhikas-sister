<h1>For My Elder Sister Radhika ❤️</h1>

<div class="letter">
<p>Dear Radhika Didi,</p>

<p>
You are not just my sister, you are my guide, my protector, and my best friend. From childhood until today, you have always been there for me in every moment of life. As my elder sister, you have always taken care of me like a second mother and supported me whenever I needed someone by my side.
</p>

<p>
I still remember how you helped me in my studies, guided me when I was confused, and stood beside me when I felt alone. Your words always gave me strength and your presence always gave me comfort. You taught me how to stay strong in difficult times and how to face life with confidence and courage.
</p>

<p>
You have sacrificed so much for our family and always put our happiness before your own. Your kindness, patience, and loving nature make you one of the most special people in my life. I feel truly lucky and blessed to have such an amazing elder sister like you.
</p>

<p>
No matter how much we grow or how busy life becomes, you will always remain my first friend and my forever support system. I promise to always respect you, care for you, and stand with you just like you have always stood with me.
</p>

<p>
Thank you for being my inspiration, my strength, and my lovely sister. I pray that you always stay happy, healthy, and successful in life. May all your dreams come true and may your life always be filled with love and joy.
</p>

<p>
With lots of love and respect,  
Your younger sibling ❤️
</p>
